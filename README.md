# README

This project aims to be a Phone Catalog where users can click any phone and see more information available.

Steps to make it work:

## BACKEND

1.  Go to **Back** folder and run `yarn install`.

2.  Then run `yarn run mongo` (MongoDB should be configurated before in your computer as shown for example in [https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/]).
3.  This is the moment when local DB should be filled. The DB should be named **DCSL** and the collection should be named **PhoneCatalog** in order to work properly. Then phones should be added to PhoneCatalog collection.

4.  Once DB is well configured run `yarn start` to deploy local MS server at [http://localhost:3001].

## FRONTEND

1.  Go to **Front** folder and run `yarn start` there to deploy the phone-catalog app at [http://localhost:3000].

**Enjoy\!**
